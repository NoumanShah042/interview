HTTP headers
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.
An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.



What do you mean by stored procedures?
What is a Stored Procedure? A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, 
so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, 
save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
