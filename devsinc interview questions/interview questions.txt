Interview 1
- oop concepts (
function override, overload
Abstract vs interface
Composition, Aggregation with code example
Why oop
Encapsulation vs abstraction with coding example
Polymorphism
Can base class points derive class)
Garbage collector in java
- coding
Place all underscore at the end of string

 Output Atifshahzaib___
- Add two linked list
 4->5->7
5->4->5
1->0->0->2
- Print linked list in reverse

Analytical
- Water jug example 
- 3 buckets of fruits , apple, mango , apple+mango..
Every bucket is labeled wrong, you can check only 1 bucket and have to labeled them correctly
-Blind person have to take a dose 1 red tablet + 1 blue in morn and even

He has 4 tablets ( 2 red, 2 blue every thing is same except color) how will the person take dose..

--------------
Interview 2
--------------
- Same oop concepts
- Design Patterns 
- Stored procedure
- 5 persons sat in round ,
Each wear a cap with number
1 2 3 4 5

1 kills 2 and handover the knife to 3 then 3 kills 4 handover the knife to 5 ,5 kills 1 and handover the knife to 3 ,3 kills 5 , survivor is 3..
Write a function for this situation

------------
Interview 3
------------
- explain yourself
- where do you see yourself in next 5 years
- why devsinc
- what's your fyp
- why this fyp?
Code to find point of intersection of 2 linked lists.
Program to print outer boundry of tree.
Program to find whether number is even or odd without using relational operator.
Store procedure, Triggers, query having group by clause
Employee k existing table ma ap nay experience wala column add krna hai... To kya kya changes hon gi front end or back end pr,
Implementation for flat function of python.Sum of all nodes of bst without loop.

Arrange all zeros in right side in O(n)  without using any extra array like [1,0,2,3,0,4,0,3] shoud be like [1,3,2,3,4,0,0,0]

What is B-tree, 2-3 tree, stored procedures, difference between abstract class and interface

Erd bnany ka Lia di thi ek or usi Erd Pa likhny ka Lia 2 queries bas

------------
Oop basics:
------------
Abstraction 
Encapsulation 
Polymorphism 
Inheritance 
Data hiding
Interfere class
Access and non access modifiers 
Overloading vs overriding

--------------
Above basics:
--------------
Diamond problem 
Abstract vs interface class
Class vs object
Why need inheritance? 
Why need polymorphism? 
Static polymorphism vs dynamic polymorphism 
Singleton class (private constructor, why need, how implemented)

----------
Database:
----------
Primary key, foreign key
Normalization 
Union and intersection
Aggregation and composition (association)
Er diagram
Cardinality and modality
How to convert from er diagram to schema (tables) 
Generalization and specialization 
Sql queries
(Nested query, aggregate func etc)
Use of join? 

Some database names

What is Oracle? 
What is sql?
What is mysql?
What is nosql?
What is sql lite?

Indexing and types

(Some query are:)
1) how to find 2nd highest salary?
2) find sum of salary of employees for each department having more than 2 employee

Triggers 
Store procedure 
Functions 
Views
----------------------
-----
Dsa:
-----
Stack 
Queue
Vector
Array
Linked list
(Singly, double, circular)
Tree
Binary tree
Bst
Avl
Graphs
Min and max heap 
Priority queue
Hash map
Hashing
Hash function
Hash table
Bfs
Dfs
Dijsktra
Bellmen ford
Knapsack
Minimun spanning tree
Shortest path algos
Etc
-------------------
Adv:(if have time)
-------------------
Greedy algo
Dynamic programming

Some Questions:
Complexity  (time and space)  of loops, recursion

Best worst and avg complexity of:
Sorting algo (merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort etc)
Search algo
Hash table

1) reverse singly linked list
2) in singly list list you are at any middle node, delete that node in O (1). Hint: you can't go on previous node but you can go forward.
3) find height of tree
4) write dijisktra algo
5) find Kth largest element in an array in O(n) 
6) find middle node in singley linked list in single loop
7) complexity of singly, double linked list for insert, delete, search, 
8) complexity of trees, bst, min max heap to insert, delete and search 
9) complexity of dijisktra, bfs, dfs
10) is dijisktra greedy or not?

These are some basic concepts of OOP, DSA and DB that are mandatory to revise before any interview.

Why devsinc
Where do you see yourself in next 5 years
Describe yourself
What's your fyp

 Wht is struct
Diff between struct and class
Wht us mode , median 
Writr code to find mode in array , without using sort or couting algo
White code to find intersection between 3 arrays
Wht is head
Wht is curent
Write code to find mid of singly list 
Write code to delte node from end of array, if user enter 2 , u will delete 2nd last node, u only have one travsel, u dnt know the length of list too,
