Hello Final year Students (BS F16, MSc F18) 
I know you guys must be very busy because the finals are approaching and you would have to manage so much along with the fyp. (if winter vacations have ended, and if not you'll be busy soon) and of course on the top of all, THE JOB TENSION. If you guys have this tension then it's great, if not then start taking it because it's really a thing. Actually I should've done this post at the start of your vacations so that you guys could've been productive to yourselves them days but couldn't find time to do so and I'm sorry for this but better late than never.
Soon you all will be promoting to your last semester and the job fear or tension would be higher then ever I know. So listen to me please.
First of all, DO NOT APPEAR IN ANY OF YOUR INTERVIEWS WITHOUT PREPARATION. trust me, it doesn't work that way. Start revising all the major concepts of all the major subjects. And you'll only get job on time if you start preparing on time. And the beginning of 8th sem would be that time. And yes. I know 4-5 subjects mids finals assignments fyp and all, but giving yourself an hour a day for your career isn't too much, is it? Trust me GPA doesn't matter if you're prepared for the interview and the test. The max that high cgpa could do to you is to make way for your cv to 3-4 high level companies. Rest all companies call majority of you and your test and interview would be what would matter there.
****Hiring Process****
Let me first tell you guys about this process. In majority of the companies it starts with a test(and every company has their own pattern of test. Some takes just mcqs based other ask you to write programs too and another type includes the analytical and IQ portion too(but these are few, mainly focus on your core concepts)) and if you clear the test only then you'll get an interview call so please appear prepared in tests. The first interview would be an HR interview in majority of the companies, in it they'll just assess your personalities you can say, your communication skills and all. It would be more of a general talk about your family and interests and hobbies mostly. And if you clear that, then you'll get a call for the technical interview. In this interview they'll start with concepts and then give you a problems to write a program for and ask you to make it time and cost efficient too. And ask you to write queries and some companies like Xavor also asks alot of analytical questions. If this interview lasts for 45 mins to an hour or (one and a half hour in my case) you are selected, congratulations. After this they'll call you for an interview with the CEO and you'll sign the joining letter in sha Allah.
***Interview Preparation****
Starting with the preparation part, first I'll say start it now. Start revising all the major subjects that includes OOP, DSA, AOA, DB, OOAD(design patterns majorly). These subjects are must along with some major concept of OS. Start searching for interview questions for OOP, DSA and all on Google and you'll get bundle of questions on many different sites including geeks for geeks, w3 school and what not. You guys know the sites better, I know. If you guys can't prepare alone, prepare in groups because you all have studied this together. Divide topics, prepare them and teach your topics next day to your friends or device any other technique idk but start Preparing. I know some of you would've already started preparing and this is very good. Do not trust your friend who's chilling around all the time saying I haven't started preparing or I don't have time for this or I'll just appear in the test as I am, without preparation. he/she will get the job first. Trust me ðŸŒš instead divide topics for them too and make them teach you.
** Applying Approach***
Start applying to the different companies by the start of your 8th sem. Right after the mids your job test will start and you'll have a test almost every weekend and then with studies it would be hell difficult for you guys to prepare your quizzes and assignments and yes THE JOB TEST. And remember, not clearing job test meaning not getting an interview call at all. So, please.
*** Communication***
Coming towards the interview calls, most of the companies reschedule your interview so if you feel like I'm not prepared to appear in an interview just the next day then request them to schedule your interview 2 to 3 days after. If they do it, that's great if they don't then utilize your night. And yes make this request on the same interview call that they make. Mostly some of your friends would've given interviews there so ask them about the questions they've been asked or you can find company wise questions or people's reviews on google too. And yes. When they call you for an interview, take their 2-3 mins and ask them everything. Ask if this is gonna be an HR interview or technical. If HR then you can be a little relaxed. Or if you've not given test for that company then also ask if they'll conduct your test before interview or not. Because many companies do take in house tests too. If you get call for any specific field then prepare that thing fully, as in if for .Net developer then prepare .Net questions very well. mostly from freshies they they don't ask field wise, they ask globally from every subject mentioned above. 
*** Know your worth & Negotiation is Must ****
AND OH YES. when they'll ask you about what you're expecting from them then please ask your seniors before going about the market competitive range of salary and ask them that. Do not go for less. And if you ace the interview they'll give you that too happily ðŸ™‚ 
These all are the things that we were not told by anyone and we learned it ourselves. I want you guys to be aware of this all procedure. 
Appear very confident in the interview. It is literally very easy to pass an interview and test if you're prepared. And preparation also includes the things that you've been studying these 4 years. So please do not get scared by this. Just prepare and it'll be very easy. Everything is available on Google. Even the questions they ask you to write program for in the interview. So just search and prepare. I'm making this post public so that most of you could get benefit from it. 
Please Make my typing worth and Ace all your interviews and end up with 2-3 offers each one of you so you could choose yourself that which company you should go with. In sha Allah. Lots of prayers for you guys.
And also i had files having interview questions in that that was asked by our batch and previous batch mostly , I'll find them and post them too.
