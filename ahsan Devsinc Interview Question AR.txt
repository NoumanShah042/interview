Introduce yourself
Explain your FYP

OOP:
What do you know about Polymorphism?
How much you have knowledge about OOP and DSA concepts.

DSA:
Why we need data structures?
Which is the fastet sorting algorithm, you know? Merge sort and QuickSort which is best?
There is a linkedlist consist of nodes. 
struct Node{
	int data;
	Node * next;
	Node * bottom;
}
Each node has 2 pointers, next pointer and bottom pointer.
You are given a head of the linked list, you need to find the sum of data of all the nodes.
e.g:
1->1->1->1
   |
   1->1->1->1
     	 |
 	 1->1->1->1->-1
	 |
	 1->1
         |
	 1
	 |
	 1->1->1
	    |
            1

Product of Array except itself
write a function f(A*, B*, size) which receive two arrays and size of array,
you need to populate the Array A in B in such a way that, B element contain the product of all the elements of A exluding ith element itself.
Time complexity = bigO(N)
if A = {1,3,2,5}, then B = {30, 10, 15, 6} 

Analytical:
You are given a cake, you need to divide the cake into 8 pieces into 3 attempts. How you will do this?
Two trains are moving towards each other with a speed of 80KM/h. 
There is a distance of 180km between them. There is a bird on the front side of first train 
which move towards second train and return back
when the bird reached the front of the second train. The bird speed is 70km/h. 
What will be the total distance covered by the bird when both trains will collide.

Database:
What is Indexing? Why we use indexing? Types of indexing?
Cluster vs non cluster indexing?
He gave me example of 3 list of index and ask me how index will map for these list.
What is use of group function in DB, why we need group explain group with example?
Explain all the joins, inner join, outer join, left outer join, right outer join with the examples. 
What is stored procedure?
What is transaction, what are the benefit to use transactions in database. Transaction Rules.
What is normalization. 
ERD:
You have a social media application. In which user can add posts.
Now, you need to add a feature of comment on the post. Multiple users can write comment on multiple posts. 
How you add this functionality. 
Now, also add the feature of reply, where multiple user can write multiple reply in post of multiple users.

Draw an ERD for quiz management, Each quiz contain quiz name, quiz start time, quiz totat time, and list of questions and student answer.
Question is a MCQs based, Question has statement and 4 options and 1 answer.
Each quiz can contain multiple questions, and each question can be used in multiple quizzez.
Student can attempt the quiz and write answer for each question of quiz.
Write a query which display the quiz name, all the question statement of the quiz and student answer.
